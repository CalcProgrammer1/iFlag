The Logo
========

	v1

_iFlag_ sports a relatively simple monochromatic logo made up of a simplified visual representation of a dot matrix style display with the dots making up a shape of a flag on a short pole. The actual color of the logo is not defined and could be any, but always only one single color. On dark backgrounds the logo should appear in a light tone.

Whenever the text wording is desired, but the form factor doesn't allow to use the full logo, a compact variant can be used:
