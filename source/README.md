The Open Source
===============

__This folder is for developers only. Fragile mortals run away now.. ;)__

_iFlag_ has been developed as a learning excercise with absolutely no commercial intentions. The software is a .NET Windows Forms application developed in MS Visual C# 2010 Express and features a C++ firmware developed with Arduino IDE. It has been released under GNU GPLv2 open source license.

[Documentation](docs)

> I must also state, that I am in no way a C# or .NET programmer or even a professional programmer and this is my first fully finished app for Windows. I did my best with the tricks of the trade I learned in the 15+ years of my web UX developer career, but there is still so much to learn and vast amounts of improvements and techniques to be adopted. If you feel like you have something to contribute to the software code, firmware code or whatever aspect of the project, please do so! The correct way would be to clone this repository, make changes and make me pull request(s). Also get in touch with PM on iRacing forum or by mail to __petr at vostrel dot cz__.
